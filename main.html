        <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>hey rhis para is all about Time complexity and efficient.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b></p>
		we take into account all the inputs 
		of the program as well as the auxiliary space used. For example,
		if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity 
		of the program becomes O(n).
